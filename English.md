To unite a community of **loyal, like-minded pioneers**, we’ve opened **BNB Coin donations on BNB Chain**. But that’s just the beginning—

#### **🔗 PayTube: The Geek’s Crypto Payment Engine**
- 🌉 **Multi-Chain Freedom**: Supports BNB Chain, Ethereum, and more—donate with *any* major crypto.
- 🦊 **1-Click MetaMask Integration**: Frictionless transactions, powered by smart contracts.
- 👁️ **Transparent & Traceable**: Every donation is on-chain. Even stalk the devs’ socials—**zero degrees of separation**.

#### **🎁 Exclusive NFT Easter Egg**
Triggered by the `about` command:
- 🖼️ **Locally generated, algorithmically unique NFT art**—yours to keep, forever.
- ✨ **A free tribute** to every open-source ally.

#### **💡 Why Crypto?**
- **Decentralized Faith**: Reject legacy finance. Code is law.
- **Geek Legacy**: Every token is a vote for hacker culture.
